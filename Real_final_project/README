# Brainwave Analysis

## Overview
This package analyzes brainwave data to identify correlations with attention and meditation levels. The workflow includes data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Removes outliers and splits datasets into awake and sleep states.
- **Data Analysis**: Computes correlation matrices, evaluates quadratic relationships, and performs feature importance analysis using Random Forest regression.
- **Visualization**: Generates heatmaps, scatter plots, R² relationship analysis, and feature importance charts.

## Detailed Analysis
### Data Cleaning
- Removes outliers using a Z-score method with a threshold of 3.5, ensuring that extreme values are excluded.
- Splits the dataset into two subsets: 
  - **Sleep dataset**: Contains observations labeled as sleep states.
  - **Awake dataset**: Contains observations labeled as awake states.
- Ensures invalid or non-numeric rows are removed during the splitting process.

### Correlation Analysis
- Computes correlation matrices for each dataset (Full, Awake, and Sleep) to identify the strength and direction of relationships between features.
- Categorizes correlations into:
  - **Strong (0.7–1.0)**: Highly significant relationships.
  - **Moderate (0.3–0.7)**: Noticeable but less strong relationships.
  - **Weak (0.0–0.3)**: Minimal relationships.
- Evaluates non-linear (quadratic) relationships between brainwave features and target variables (attention and meditation) using R² values.

### Random Forest Analysis
- Performs Random Forest regression to analyze feature importance and calculate R² values for attention and meditation.
- Outputs feature importance and R² scores for both target variables, helping identify the most impactful brainwave features.

### Visualization
- **Heatmaps**: Displays correlation matrices using a visually intuitive color-coded grid.
- **Scatter Plots**: Plots brainwave features (e.g., delta, theta) against attention and meditation levels, with log-scaled axes for better trend analysis.
- **R² Heatmaps**: Visualizes the strength of quadratic relationships between brainwave features and target variables.
- **Feature Importance Charts**: Bar charts displaying feature importance for attention and meditation variables.
